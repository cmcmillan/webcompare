<P>
The LV_Stages list is quite simple. Each line represents a single
stage within a vehicle, and gives the vehicle name, the vehicle variant
(usually blank), the stage number (which can be -1 or 0 for strapons),
the stage name (which maps to the Stages file), a flag to indicate
uncertainty (not confirmed that this stage is the correct one) and
a flag to indicate a dummy stage (e.g. the Cora vehicle always carries
a dummy Astris stage), and finally the stage multiplicity:
e.g. stage 0 of the ASLV consists of two AS-0 strapon stages, and so
has multiplicity 2.
