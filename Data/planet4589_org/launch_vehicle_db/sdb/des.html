<P>
In my launch vehicle database, I have assigned designations
to suborbital vehicles. 
<P>
<P>
The WDC/RS-A system for sounding
rockets assigned numbers of the form R7402-1311, for the 11th
cataloged launch on 1974 Feb 13. I considered retaining these
designations but instead have found it more useful to
use a scheme similar to international designations for orbital launches.
<P>
(Note: In earlier editions I used a different scheme).
<P>
The first scheme for designating orbital launches was the Harvard scheme,
invented by Fred Whipple and colleagues in 1957 and published in the Harvard
Announcement Circulars from the Harvard Observatory. This was of the
form "year - greek letter - piece number", as in "1957 Alpha 2", indicating
the second object of the first (Alpha) launch of 1957.
<P>
This scheme was used until the end of 1962. It was replaced by the COSPAR
designation of the form "year - launch number - piece letter", as in
2005-012E, indicating the fifth (E) piece of the 12th launch of 2005.
The piece letters run from A to Z, then AA to AZ, BA ... to ZZ, AAA to AAZ,
etc., always omitting the letters I and O. Usually, the first piece
letters are reserved for the main payloads, followed by the rocket stages,
followed by debris. Also usually, the launch numbers are in chronological
order within the year. However, there are exceptions to both of these rules.
<P>
In principle, international designations are assigned to launches and pieces
of launches which either complete a full orbit of the Earth or reach
the Moon or beyond. Again, there are exceptions - launches which completed
an orbit but did not get a designation, and launches or pieces which
did not complete and orbit but got a designation anyway.
<P>
A few years ago I introduced a catalog of orbital launch failures which
assigned analogous designations for failures, of the form 2005-F01, etc.
where the F indicates 'Failure'. These designations only label launches;
I have not assigned piece letters to individual failed space objects.
<P>
I have also used 'E' to indicate a pad explosion, and 'U' to indicate
a launch that should have received a regular designation but did not
(e.g. 1995-U01). 
<P>
In my new scheme, I extend this approach to label all of the non-orbital launches
in my catalog by adding new special letters to the launch number:
1995-S01, 1995-A01, etc. You might call this the "JSR" scheme or even the
"New Harvard" scheme <I>(technically
I work for the Smithsonian Institution's SAO, and I'm doing this on my own time, but
to the extent that I'm on the Harvard campus and support space-related outreach inquiries for the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics, and recalling that Fred's satellite support team  was an SAO program too, it's good enough.)</I>
<P>
In the table below, NL is the number of launches in the catalog for each type as of July 2005.

<P>
Since the non-orbital catalog is incomplete, and I often
identify previously undocumented historical launches, there are many more
cases of launch numbers that are not chronological. Thus,
1961-S227 may have a launch date earlier than 1961-S612.  
<P>
I've separated rocket flights into space (S) from those at low altitudes in the
atmosphere (A) and added an intermediate category (M) for the 50-80 km range
in the mesosphere.
<P>
I've also separated out some small meteorological rocket launches which would
normally be in the M and S categories, and instead labelled them W and Y respectively.
That's because there's a lot of these small rockets and the data on them is
very incomplete; I'm hoping the M and S lists are relatively complete, although
every day I'm finding that's not the case.
<P>
Another wrinkle is that launches can change designation. If I've got
documentation on a Nike Apache launch with no information on apogee, I
may assume it worked and give it an S designation. If I later find it
failed at low altitude, I will retire the S designation and assign a new
A designation. A retired designation that has been used in a public
release will not be reused. (However, I
may fill in missing designations in the first public release caused by
cases like this that I've already found.)
<P>
In this release, I have deleted the Hound Dog and X-10 launch lists,
since they were vehicles which travelled within the atmosphere with no
rocket propulsion, and so fall outside the scope of my interest.
<P>
I have also provided a <A HREF="recat.xid.main">cross-index</A> of the old and new 
designation systems.
