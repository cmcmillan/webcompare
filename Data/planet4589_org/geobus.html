=========================

Here I summarize launches of geostationary satellites from 1963 to early 2009.
(Up to the launch of Telstar 11N in 2009).

I compare the number made by the US and other nations; and the number
owned by US organizations and non-US organizations. 

I look at all GEO satellites (including weather, signals intelligence etc),
and separately at communications satellites only.

The full lists are at <a href="http://planet4589.org/space/log/geobus0902.ok.lis">geobus0902.ok.lis</a>
and  <a href="http://planet4589.org/space/log/geobus0902.fail.lis">geobus0902.fail.lis</a>. These lists
include the satellite bus type and the number of years the satellite
remained functional.


Fine print: Satellites are included if they were active payloads which
at some point had an Earth orbital period between 23 and 25 hours.
Satellites which operated successfully in GEO even for a short time are
counted as success for the purposes of this study (the implication is
successful launch, not successful overall mission). Pre-privatization
Intelsat satellites are counted as US. SEA LAUNCH is counted as a US
launch, since Boeing provides launch services (although rocket is
Ukrainian/Russian).  Issues of dual ownership or manufacture (eg Anik D)
and other fuzziness in definitions were resolved using my best
judgement. 

The manufacturer with the most GEO satellites is the El Segundo factory
which was formerly Hughes and is now Boeing. They have
 200 +/- 5 GEO satellites with 13 failed at launch. (the uncertainty is
due to secret satellites whose manufacturers were not reliably leaked.)
